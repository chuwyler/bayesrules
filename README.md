# Inofficial solutions to the book "Bayes Rules!"

I found the book [Bayes rules!](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) by A. A. Johnson, M. Q. Ott and M. Dogucu an excellent read and a good introduction to Bayesian modeling.
Since to my knowledge no official solutions to the exercises are available, I present my **inofficial** solutions here. With this let me also issue the warning that there might be mistakes in my solutions. I did not proof-read them and a range of typos or even more serious conceptual mistakes might be present. If you use the solutions and spot a possible mistake, please let me know by opening an issue, I will happily fix it.

I put the answers to the conceptual / more theoretical exercises into a PDF (**TBD: link**) and the answers to the applied exercises into Jupyter notebooks with R for the individual chapter (**TBD: link**). For efficiency, I also created a html file for each notebook.

Have fun!
